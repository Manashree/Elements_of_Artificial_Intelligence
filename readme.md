Assignments from CS B551 - Elements of Artificial Intelligence

1. Decision-Making for Tic-Tac-Toe - implementing a “simple reflex agent”
2. Understand and apply Graph Search to real world problems. Implemented following algorithms:
	1.    Breadth First Search
	2.    Depth First Search
	3.    Best First Search (with a heuristic)
	4.    Best First Search (with another heuristic)
	5.    A* Search
3. Adverserial Search- Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning with custom evaluation function, test it against random play
4. Genetic Algorithms for Local Search/Learning - The 0-1 Knapsack Problem(NP problem) is an example of a combinatorial optimization problem, which seeks to maximize the benefit of objects in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity and is an ideal candidate for Genetic Algorithms.
